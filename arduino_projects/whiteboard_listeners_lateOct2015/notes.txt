mini sumo code with listeners
NOTES

interfaces needed: Observer, Observee
classes needed: the 6 sensors are Observers (class ColorSensor and class DistanceSensor). they call the robot which is an observee to take according action
the classes will differentiate themselves by analog port id


// what do the notifications from the sensors look like?
* The 3 color sensors will notify when they detect white and the robot, depending on which sensor squeaked, will have to avoid white with appropriate direction. The alarm is for white.
* Same for distance sensors. Each sensor squeak has a certain way of reaction. if front charge, if side, turn towards it facing it front. The alarm is for close.

// why need listeners?
Because I need to be interrupted from my searching loop. It's no use writing the same code which contains the main code in every while loop which would have a while loop which would have a while loop which would have ...
